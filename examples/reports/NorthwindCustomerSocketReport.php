	<li> Choose an option and confirm that it works </li> 
	<li> Choose an option that is impossible to do with just search and/or sort in datatabels and confirm that this works </li>
	<li> Make sure that the data comes back when you turn off the data options </li>

	<li> Confirm that there are seperate caches created for each data option in _zermelo_cache </li>
